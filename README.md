### Overview
A simple **Block Blast-style puzzle** implemented entirely in Verilog on the **Intel DE1-SoC (Cyclone V)** FPGA.  
Keyboard input comes through the **PS/2 port**, and video is displayed via **VGA (640×480)**.  
The core gameplay logic, VGA renderer, and timing control are all written from scratch.
